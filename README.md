4. Select the folder from Step 1 that holds `background.js`, `content.js`, and `manifest.json`.
5. The extension should now be loaded into your browser. Make sure the extension is enabled.
6. Right click (or double finger click) on an image and select the "Download WebP as PNG" option from the context menu. This will convert the WebP image into a PNG and save it as `image.png` to your device!
7. You can manage the extension like any other extension. You can disable and remove the extension as needed.
8. To update to the latest version of the extension, remove/delete the extension and repeat the steps starting with Step 1 using the latest version of the code.
